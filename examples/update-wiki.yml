# This is an example of a workflow file that updates wiki pages.
# You put this file in the .github/workflows directory of your repository,
# e.g. `.github/workflows/update-wiki.yml`.
#
# The script should be in the `bin` directory at the root of your wiki repository,
# please use `git` from CLI to add it.
#
# Note that you might need to go to your repository settings and enable using all actions,
# not only from your ogranization, if you are using a private repository in an organization.
